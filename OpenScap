# Script to Perform Security Audits Using OpenSCAP
# This script installs required tools, performs a security scan based on SCAP content, and generates an HTML report.
# This script was tested on Cent OS Stream 9

# Step 1: Install Required Packages
# - `httpd`: A web server that may be required for hosting or accessing reports.
# - `openscap-scanner`: The OpenSCAP command-line tool for performing security scans.
# - `scap-security-guide`: Contains predefined SCAP content for various operating systems.
sudo dnf install -y httpd openscap-scanner scap-security-guide

# Step 2: Locate SCAP Security Content
# SCAP content files are typically stored in `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/`.
# Navigate to this directory or refer to its contents for the appropriate XML file.
cd /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/
ls

# Step 3: View SCAP Content Information
# Use the `oscap info` command to inspect the SCAP content file and learn about available profiles.
# Replace `ssg-cs9-ds.xml` with the SCAP content file appropriate for your operating system version.
oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-cs9-ds.xml

# Step 4: Run a Security Audit
# Use the `oscap xccdf eval` command to perform an evaluation based on the specified profile.
# - `--profile`: Specifies the security baseline to evaluate against. In this case, we use `ospp` (Protection Profile for general-purpose operating systems).
# - `--results`: Outputs the evaluation results to an XML file.
# - `--report`: Generates an easy-to-read HTML report.
# Replace `ssg-cs9-ds.xml` with the appropriate SCAP content file for your system.
oscap xccdf eval \
--profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp \
--results ssg-cs9-ds.xml \
--report ssg-cs9-ds.html \
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-cs9-ds.xml

# Step 5: View the HTML Report
# Replace `ssg-cs9-ds.html` with the name of your generated report if different.
firefox ssg-cs9-ds.html
