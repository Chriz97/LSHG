# Script for CVE Remediation: CVE-2024-52336
# This script demonstrates how to use Red Hat's rhc connect, insights-client, and dnf 
# to identify and remediate CVE-2024-52336.

# What is CVE Remediation?
# CVE Remediation involves identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in your system.
# Using Red Hat Insights and dnf, we can efficiently mitigate CVEs by applying security updates.

# This script is inspired by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Interactive Lab, see below

# Step 1: Check the Status of rhc connect
# Ensure rhc connect is properly set up.
sudo rhc status

# Step 2: Verify insights-client Installation
# Check if insights-client is installed.
sudo dnf install -y insights-client

# Step 3: Register the System with Red Hat Insights
# Ensure the system is registered with Red Hat Insights.
sudo insights-client --register

# Step 4: Run insights-client to Identify Vulnerabilities
# Execute insights-client to fetch the latest vulnerability report.
sudo insights-client

# Step 5: Check for Available Updates for CVE-2024-52336
# Use dnf to check for updates addressing the specific CVE.
sudo dnf updateinfo list --cves | grep CVE-2024-52336

# Step 6: Apply the Fix for CVE-2024-52336
# Update the system packages to remediate the CVE.
sudo dnf update -y --cve CVE-2024-52336

# Step 7: Re-run insights-client Post Remediation
# Verify that the CVE has been addressed by running insights-client again.
sudo insights-client

# Step 8: Check Recommended Actions from Red Hat Insights
# Display any additional recommendations from Red Hat Insights.
sudo insights-client --recommend

# Step 9: List Installed Updates for Verification
# Ensure the specific package updates have been applied.
sudo dnf history info | grep CVE-2024-52336

# Step 10: Perform a System Reboot (if required)
# Reboot the system to apply kernel or critical updates.
echo "Checking if a reboot is required..."
if [ -f /var/run/reboot-required ]; then
    echo "Reboot is required. Rebooting now..."
    sudo reboot
else
    echo "No reboot is required."
